## Neural Network Visualizer.

<h3>The aim of this project is to visualize the outputs of each layer in a Neural Network. <br> 
1) First the Flask server is made active, wherein the model is loaded. <br>
2) The server accepts the post request and responds back with the prediction as well as the random image generated. <br>
3) The web app is made via Streamlit. <br>
4) Upon clicking on the "Generate Image" Button, a post request is sent to the ML Flask server. <br>
5) The response is loaded and the output of the various layer is displayed on the screen. <br>
